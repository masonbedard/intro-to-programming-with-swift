## Variables

A variable is a box that can hold something inside of it. When you have many boxes, you want to give them labels so that you can tell which box is which.

In Swift, you can put something inside of a labeled box using the = sign. For now, whenever we label a box, we also want to put something inside of it. Here is how you do that.

```
  var myBox = 5
